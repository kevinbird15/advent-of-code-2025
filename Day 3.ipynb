    "I don't really like my solution to part 1 and part 2 of my advent of code challenge is asking me to put together the largest number that I can with 12 digits (rather than the 2 digits I stumbled my way through above).  I think sorting the values is a good way to start finding the largest possible value, and maybe that is what I need to do for part 2. So I guess the things I need to change are instead of si_end being a single value, it should be the last 11 digits and I need to make some sort of loop where the first time through, we find the largest digit in the left-most position (which I think find already does for us). And then that shrinks our candidates to be that position + 1.  It feels kind of recursive-y to me.  What do you think?\n",
